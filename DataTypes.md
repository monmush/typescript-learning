**Type annotations** are what developers tell Typescript the type

When to use:

1. When we declear a variable on one line and initialize it after
2. When we want a variable to have a type that can't be inferred
3. When a function returns the 'any' type that we need to clarify the value

**Type inference** is what Typescript guesses the type

When to use:

1. Always!!
